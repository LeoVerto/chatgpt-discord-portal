This tool allows you to open a portal to one of these alternate dimensions and to chat
with members of a faraway yet oddly familiar community.

## Setup
Create a Discord bot and add it to your server.
On this server, also create a webhook for the channel you want the bot to post to.

Run the bot using `pdm run main.py`.
